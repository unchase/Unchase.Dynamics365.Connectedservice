[Unchase Dynamics365 Connected Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Unchase.unchaseDynamics365ConnectedService) is a Visual Studio 2017/2019 extension to generate early-bound .NET Framework (or C++) classes that represent the entity data model used by Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement.

### Installation completes but I can't see the Service in the list of connected services (Visual Studio 2019)

- Relevant [bug report](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/468751/vs2019-preview-cannot-install-connected-service-ex.html). `Connected Services` restored in the v16.1.3 update to [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) 2019.
